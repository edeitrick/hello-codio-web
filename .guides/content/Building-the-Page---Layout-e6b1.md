# Layout

Since web development requires editing several files at once, choosing the best layout becomes important for user experience. In the Guide Editor, click the gear icon in the top-left corner.

The default layout is `Previous`, which inherits the settings from the previous page in the Guide. Each page can have a different layout if need be. There are three main areas to take into account: a place to edit files, a place to see the output, and the Guide (lesson material). Codio offers a three-panel or three-column layout. One layout is not necessarily better than the other, though each one makes tradeoffs.
